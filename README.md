#   BBDownload â€“ BeachBoard Content Downloader
This short script grabs all files from BeachBoard @ CSULB (hopefully),
unless the system breaks (which occurs often) or have some major changes.


##  License
This project is distributed under GPLv3 by Mushinako. This project comes
with absolutely NO warranty, and I am NOT responsible for any data loss
and/or leak. I'm not an expert on data security (though trying to be).
**Please only test this script if you understand what you and this script
are doing!**


## Description
**Please pin your courses that you would like to be downloaded.**

When first run, this program will ask you for your credentials, and a file
  named "data.json" should appear in "data" folder, storing necessary data.

You also need a password, ideally different from your CSULB password, to
encrypt the latter in the file. You will need this password EVERY time you
run this program, as you need to decrypt your CSULB password every time.

All the contents and grades will be written into "Contents" folder.

The same file will not be overwritten, but different files with the same
name (possibly different versions) will be renamed by attaching " (1)",
" (2)", etc.


##  Usage
### On Windows:
- Double-click on `app.bat` or run `.\app.bat [-h|-c|-r]` from command line

### On Mac OS/Linux:
- Make `app.sh` executable (`chmod +x ./app.sh`)
- Double-click on `app.sh` or run `./app.sh [-h|-c|-r]` from terminal

### Alternative:
- Use `python3 app [-h|-c|-r]` in this directory


## Arguments

-h/--help             Show this text

                        this every time the instructor changes anything
                        on BeachBoard
-r/--reset            Force reset. "data.json" will be deleted and you
                        will need to re-setup. You'll have to do this if
                        you lose your passphrase for this app
-t/--content          Download contents only
-g/--grade [format]   Download grades only. Result would be in selected
                        format. See formats below
