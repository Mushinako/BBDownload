#   bbdownload â€“ BeachBoard Content Downloader
This short script grabs all files from BeachBoard @ CSULB (hopefully),
unless the system breaks (which occurs often) or have some major changes.

and/or leak. ~~Please only test this script if you understand what you and
this script are doing!~~ Do not test this script now as the setup procedure
is not completed yet!

##  Requirement
Python 3.6+

##  Usage
Click on `app.bat` or run `app.bat [-h|-r]` from command line if you're using
Windows. Use `python3 app.py [-h|-r]` on macOS or Linux.

~~[This program needs to be setup at the first time, asking you for your
credentials, and a file named "data.json" should appear, storing
necessary data. This file will refresh once every 5 times the program is
run. (FUTURE)]~~

You also need a password, ideally different from your CSULB password, to
encrypt the latter in the file. You will need this password EVERY time you
run this program, as you need to decrypt your CSULB password every time.

The same file will not be overwritten, but different files with the same
name (possibly different versions) will be renamed by attaching " (1)",
" (2)", etc.

### ARGUMENTS
-h, --help      Show this text
-r, --reset     Force reset. "data.json" will be deleted and you will
                need to re-setup. You may likely have to do this every
                semester.
